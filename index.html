          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>St. Louis Toasted Ravioli was invented in 1946 by the owner of a St. Louis restaurant, Tony Gemignani. Gemignani was inspired by a similar dish he had eaten in Sicily. He created the dish by deep-frying ravioli and serving it with marinara sauce. The dish was an immediate success, and Gemignani's restaurant became known for it. The dish was later popularized by the restaurant chain Imo's Pizza, which opened in 1960. Imo's Pizza is credited with popularizing the dish outside of St. Louis.</p>
